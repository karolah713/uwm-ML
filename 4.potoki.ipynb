Potoki transformujące pomagają unikać zjawiska wycieków informacji z danych treningowych do danych testowych za sprawą izolowania poznanych transformacji do danych treningowych, a następnie stosowanie tych samych transformacji do danych testowych lub walidacyjnych. Zastosowanie takich operacji optymalizujących transformacje wpływają pozytywnie na oszczędność czasu potrzebnego na ogarnięcie dużych fragmentów kodu, a także na walkę z późniejszymi błędami."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WMA_cIznRKgX"},"source":["## Stosowanie gotowych transformatorów\n","\n","Stosowanie potoków transformujących polega na utworzeniu instancji klasy **Pipeline**, której inicjalizator przyjmuje listę zawierającą sprecyzowane kroki przetwarzające dane w postaci krotek: (nazwa, estymator).
